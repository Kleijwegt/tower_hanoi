# Solve tower of hanoi problem using recursion
While looking at functional programming I encountered this example. I deceided to work it out share it with collegea during a knowledge transfer and publish it here.
The example is about a short script testing/explaining the recusion 'super' power from [Thorsten Altenkirch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lhxIOAfDss). The example solves the tower of hanoi problem.
